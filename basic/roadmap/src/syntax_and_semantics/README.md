## 1. Variables

**mutable & immutable**:

- All variables are immutable by default

**questions**:

- What is the difference between let x = 5; and let mut y = 10;? Why might you get a compiler error if you try to reassign a value to x?

- What is mutable & immutable?

## 2. Constants

- Like immutable variables, constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants and variables.

- Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words.

### Showing

- Shadowing is different from marking a variable as mut because we’ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the let keyword. By using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

- The other difference between mut and shadowing is that because we’re effectively creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, and then we want to store that input as a number
