# Product Overview

This is a Rust learning repository that demonstrates core Rust concepts through executable examples. The project serves as a comprehensive reference for Rust fundamentals including:

- Syntax and semantics (variables, data types, control flow, pattern matching)
- Ownership system (ownership rules, borrowing, references, slices)
- Data structures (primitives, arrays, tuples, strings)
- Language constructs (structs, enums, traits, impl blocks)

Each module contains runnable examples with detailed explanations and comments, designed for learning and reference purposes.
